This is a program to calculate numerical solutions of a quasi-one-dimensional flows through a convergent-divergent nozzle. This program can solve isentropic and non-isentropic flows. The nozzle exit pressure is varied to change the flow conditions. This program solved continuity, momentum, and energy conservation equation in the form of non-dimensionalized compact form. MacCormack scheme is used as the discritization technique.

To do the calculation, please follow the instruction within TestSample.py files.
